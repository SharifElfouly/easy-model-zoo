# Pretrained-Model-Zoo

Are you also frustrated by the installation process of different models? You are tired of Docker and C extensions failing while compiling. You just want to try out a new model to see how fast and accurate it is? Then you are at the right place!

The only **requirement** of theses models is that they are pip installable.

PRs are always welcome!
